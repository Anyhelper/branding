This is the script of some of Apples branding video

I have been thinking a lot about innovation lately, how does that happen?
For me, it's having a great team that is empowered and given the space to do what they know how to do.

We get to realize ideas. And Apple people have some crazy ideas.
Just to be with all these smart people here -- it's hugely inspiring.
Plus you know you are working on a product that's going to reach millions of people.
What can be better than that?

I take a lot of pride in what I do and so does everyone I work with.
And being around people who care so deeply about what they do that really is what motivates me.

There are very few individuals that go into the level of detail that we do. We drive consistently for perfection

BUt all those technical things, all they do is they add up to an exeprience for the customer. That is seamless that is easy, that is just natural.

"Oh that is so cool! I love it!"

It all looks so smoothless and seamless.
Underneath, every single detail has thousands of people behind it.

We at Apple are lookg for people who are passionate about what they do. And that passion it doesn't necessarily come from education. Doesn't necessarily come from education. It comes from within.
